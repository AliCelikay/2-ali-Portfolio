This code shows a portfolio and talks about me, my projects, and shows how to get in contact with me. There is my picture at the top as well as my name. You can find more about me by cliking on any of the links in the nav bar to take you to the corresponding section of the page.

There is a link on the first image under the work section. If you click the image it will take you to the project I worked on with my group.

The 3 pixels this works at is 576px, 768px, and 992px.
