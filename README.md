# CSS and HTML Portfolio

## Description
This application is my first attempt at making a portfolio for my projects. The application consists of only CSS and HTML languages. It is also responsive with 3 media queries to work with desktop(992px), tablet(768px), and phone screen(576px) widths. I have an about page, list of my personal projects and group projects, and mycontact information

This code shows a portfolio and talks about me, my projects, and shows how to get in contact with me. There is my picture at the top as well as my name. You can find more about me by cliking on any of the links in the nav bar to take you to the corresponding section of the page.

The 3 pixels this works at is 576px, 768px, and 992px.
